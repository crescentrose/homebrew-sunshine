# Homebrew sunshine formula

This is a Homebrew formula for the [Sunshine command-line
tool](https://github.com/crescentrose/sunshine).

To save you from Rust compile times, this formula will download a pre-compiled
version. If you want to compile Sunshine yourself, head over to [the main
repository](https://github.com/crescentrose/sunshine) and read the (very brief
and concise) "Building" section.

## Installation

Install like you would any other tap:

```bash
brew tap crescentrose/sunshine
brew install sunshine
```
